Wiselib CTP Algorithm Testing Guide
===================================================================


This document is intended to be a short guide for how to use the Wiselib CTP algorithm in an application and how to test some basic functionality.

All the code related to the CTP implementation resides under /wiselib.stable/algorithms/routing/ctp. 



------------ Employing CTP in an application --------------

The file ctp_test.cpp found under /apps/generic_apps/ctp_test/ctp_test.cpp can serve as a model for employing the CTP algorithm and  stacking the its components. After initializing the components, we must set up the root node as root inside the Routing engine by calling the set_root() method. 


The main app must inteface directly only with the FE module. The FE module, besides the methods specific to the Routing protocol, exposes the is_congested() method, which returns true if the current node is congested. Based on this, the app may take some decisions. Congestion detection and traffic balancing can be enabled/disabled through the ECN_ENABLED (Explicit Congestion Notification) template parameter in the RE.


------------ Setting up the test scenario ------------------

We are aiming to prove that given a network topology, the algorithm can find the best path to a root and that it can adapt to a change in the topology (e.g. failure of a node, change in link quality etc.). Since we don't always have a static network topology to test on, I designed the testing setup so that we can define our own topology in code.

The radio defined in debug_radio.h is used only while debugging. It is used to filter the incoming messages to a node based on the topology defined by the user. Everything a user would want to change to configure for a test setup is in the ctp_debugging.h file. There we can define a network topology by first listing all nodes that it consists of (NODES). Since the node IDs can vary depending on the testbed, nodes in our topology are referred to with their index in the NODES array, so we only have to update this array with the actual node ids when we test on a different testbed.
We can go on with designing the topology by defining the links between the nodes as undirected edges with costs, as 3-tuples of {node1,node2,link_quality} (LINKS). For this, of course, we must make sure that the two nodes are actually within each other's reach. We can force the LE module to report our predefined link qualities (ETX values) by defining the DEBUG_ETX macro.

We also must specify at least one root node in the ROOT_NODES list that will act as a sink for messages (the main app will enable the root nodes based on this).

We can also define a list of nodes that we want to print debug messages on (DEBUG_NODES).
